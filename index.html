        <p style="text-align: center; text-align: justify;">Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images, <br>
            visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than <br>anything else, they are made of words. Oh so many words. As <br>we equip teams to design and code usable, consistent,<br> beautiful interfaces using systems, it's essential that words <br>depend on a strong foundation of typography.</p>

                I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design <br>
                 degree. I'm never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or <br>
                  finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant <br>to write about typography.

                On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've<br> contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for <br>typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a <br>foundation and apply it to an emerging library of interface <br>components. This article summarizes those patterns.

                Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and <br> weights along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build<br> hierarchy using size, color, additional details like line-height,<br> and layering responsiveness. Those models are then applied <br>to components in a system's library (like Article and Header) <br>as well as custom components made by other teams.
